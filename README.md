To run the ``Java codes`` in this repository,you can do the following:
* Download or clone the repo to a file.
* To test a particular method implementation(eg ``binaryOfPositiveInts(int)`` ), call the method in the ``main method`` supplying it with argument(s).
* In the case of a particular class implementation, each class implementation has one or two methods that perform different tasks. Instantiate the ``class`` of interest and call the necessary method of interest, supplying the required argument(s) if necessary.
