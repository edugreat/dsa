Draw all of the diferent heaps that can be made from the five keys A B C D E,then draw all the different heaps that can be made from the five keys A A A B B.

For keys  A B C D E:
starting with index = 1. The children of root whose index is at x would occur at the index 2*x and 2*x+1.
For max priority queue, the queue arrangement would be 

                              E
							  ' '
							 '    '
							D       B
							' '
						   '    '    
						   A     C
						   
For min priority queue:
                               A
							  ' '
							 '    '
							B       C

						   D     E
					
For keys A A A B B
